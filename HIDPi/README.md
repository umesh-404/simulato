# HIDPi - Keyboard & Mouse (more devices are on the way)
## About This Project
This project focuses on a simple way to set up a Raspberry Pi 4B/5 (and maybe others) as a USB HID device. It can be installed via a one-liner.

I created this because I was getting really annoyed about the lack of info on using Pis other than the Zero as USB HID devices. There are many posts that mention doing it, but they never seem to work. There are also many posts saying only the Pico or Zero can do it.

I've tested it on a Raspberry Pi 4B 8GB model from 2018, running Raspberry Pi OS lite (32-bit), Debian Bookworm. It probably works on 64-bit but I haven't tried it yet. We have 2 confirmed tests on a Raspberry Pi 5 (specifics can be found [here](https://github.com/rikka-chunibyo/HIDPi/wiki/Compatibility)).

To connect the Raspberry Pi to a computer as a USB HID device, you must use a USB-A to USB-C cable. A USB-C to USB-C cable should also work if your computer has a USB-C port. You may NOT use one of the USB-A ports on the Pi to plug it into a computer. The USB cable MUST support data transfer/have data wires.

Currently, the mouse doesn't work properly on Windows. You may still use it via using raw commands from the manual usage section in the wiki, though you may have to edit the command. I originally built this for macOS, so all the features were tested on it. Windows came after.

## Issues
I usually respond fast, I honestly don't know much about all of this, I just scrapped together some commands and stuff, but I'll try my best to help. 

If there's an issue while your using a different OS, please open an issue about adding support for it, I'd like this project to be as plug-and-play and simple as possible.

Not really about issues but if you have any suggestions for improvements or anything feel free to open a discussion about it.

Please create an issue if something is unclear or wrong, I used AI to generate the comments which are used to generate documentation.
